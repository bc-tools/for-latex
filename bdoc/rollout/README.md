About `bcdoc`
-------------

This package proposes some macros and environments to write semantically human-friendly documentations of `LaTeX` packages and classes with a tutorial-like flavour.


Where is the documentation?
---------------------------

At this time, there is only one French documentation writing with a tutorial-like flavor : look at the folder `rollout/doc`.
