[[:facto:]]
Instead of using the ``most`` option in  ``\RequirePackage[most]{tcolorbox}``, we just add the library ``skins`` via ``\tcbuselibrary``.

[[:bug:]]
The ugly hack for french quotes was a partial copy of some part of the ``babel`` package source code.

    1) Right quote: ``\ignorespaces`` has been added at the end.

    1) Left quote: ``\ifdim\lastskip>\z@\unskip\fi`` starts the definition.

    1) Better unbreakable spacing: ``\kern.25em`` replaces ``\,``.

[[:api:]]
The new macro ``\docnew`` can be used to indicate the date of something new.

[[:api:]]
The macro ``\docilatex`` has been added to display inline ¨latex codes (verb::``i`` is for "inline").

[[:api:]]
For showcases, the text indicating the start and the end of a showcase can be customized.

:update:

[[:api:]]
The option of the ¨env ``doctopic`` must be put after the title now.

Decorations: the macro ``\docsep`` produces a more "symmetrical" vertical spacing.

[[:tech:]]
The macro ``\docquote`` uses ``\og`` and ``\fg`` that come from ``\usepackage[french]{babel}`` but the problem is that ``babel`` is no longer loaded automatically. So now, if necessary, we define our version of ``\og`` and ``\fg`` via ``\providecommand`` (for French, we just mimic the code of babel and for English we define the expected double quotes).

For the date and the number of a version, the macro ``\docversion`` prints now the date with the format of the language loaded with ¨bdoc.

[[:api:]]
For ¨latex examples and their output, the macros ``\inputdoclatexafter``, ``\inputdoclatexbefore`` and ``\inputdoclatexreal`` have now an optional argument to change the explaining text.

[[:format:]]
For showcases, the strip contains also now the focusing rules, and it uses a blue color instead of a green one.

[[:api:]]
The macros ``\docexa`` and ``\docexa*`` work with an optional argument instead of a mandatory one: this allows to only type ``\docexa`` or ``\docexa*`` without any curly braces.

[[:format:]]
The printing of codes has been enhanced.

    1) The frame uses tiny rounded corners for a smoother output and a shadow because it is so cute...

    1) The separating line is thicker and uses a customized path for the dashes.

    1) The back color has been changed to a light yellow.

The package can be loaded by **indicating the language to use** (only the French and the English are supported at this time).

For showcases, the rulers are automatically set to obtain the same global width before and after the rendering.

[[:api:]]
The resbonsabilities of the package have been minimized: the user has to manage alone imports like ``\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}`` and ``\usepackage[french]{babel, varioref}`` (but the automatic tools will do it when generating ¨docs for the ¨tns series).

The preferred coding language will be ¨latex3 (some more advanced and optional features will be coded in ¨lua).

[[:flow:]]
The code is now developed like other independent packages of the ¨tns series (it remains to build the automatic tools and then we will be ready to publish a version of ¨bcode for users).

The macro ``\signprewhy`` has been removed. It will be proposed by the package ¨macroenvsign (this is more logical).

The ¨env ``remark`` has been renamed ``docremark``.
