Showcase.

    1) The new ``\bdocshowcaseinput`` allows to import a \latex file for a showcase.

    1) The unknown key options are not longer allowed with the \env ``bdoclatexshow`` and the macro ``\bdoclatexshow``.

Showcase.

    1) The \env ``bdoclatexshow`` offers a key-val option for defining the output: there's more to write, but the interface is easier to remember. This involves deleting the star \env ``bdoclatexshow*``.

    1) Similarly, the macro ``\bdoclatexshow*`` has been removed because ``\bdoclatexshow`` offers now a key-value option for modifying certain parameters.

    1) ``\bdocbackcolor`` becomes ``\bdoclightcolor``.

Showcase: the change made to the colour previously implemented in the ``bdocshowcase`` environment has been moved to the ``bdocshowcase*`` environment.


[[:doc:]]
Two things done.

    1) The latest changes for users were missing...

    1) A warning has been added about a weakness in the ``clrstrip`` package.

[[:api:]]
Some simplifications have been made.

    1) The \lang name follows the ``babel`` package conventions: for example, ``lang = french`` must be used instead of the previous ``lang = FR``.

    1) Regarding the listings...

        + Just one \env ``bdoclatex`` and one macro ``\bdoclatexinput`` are proposed to display codes. The output can be changed using just one optional \arg.

        + The environment ``bdoclatexshow`` works with special delimited optional \args suchas to simplify the \api.

    1) The ``bdocprewhy`` macro has been rewritten.

        + You have to type ``\bdocprewhy{pre.fix}`` instead of the previous ``\bdocprewhy{pre}{fix}``.

        + ``\cdot`` has been replaced by ``\textperiodcentered`` with small spaces around it.

    1) Regarding the changelog...

        + The ``bdoctopic`` \env now works with two types of optional delimited \args instead of one optional type suchas to simplify the \api.

        + The macro ``\bdocnew`` has been renamed ``\bdocdate``.

[[:api:]]
Here are the new features.

    1) Two environments ``bdocwarning`` and ``bdocinfo`` have been added: this allows to focus some content more precisely.

    1) The new environments ``bdoclatexshow*`` and ``bdocshowcase*`` work without the ``clrstrip`` package.

    1) If the ``babel`` package is loaded with the ``french`` \lang, we use ``\babelshorthand{:}`` to obtain a well spaced colon in texts.

    1) The ``csquotes`` package is used to manage properly the quoting. This package takes care of locale settings.

[[:doc:]]
The \tech \docs in the \src have been updated.


[[:api:]]
A few things to know...

    1) The package ``xcolor`` is loaded instead of ``pgf``, this last on was used only for colors (keys are now managed with \latex3).

    1) The setting of ``\thechapter`` is made only if it is necessary.

    1) All the ``\RequirePackage`` indicate one date.

    1) The ``bdocexa`` \env is now made using an ``amsthm`` \env like the ``bdocrem`` \env.
