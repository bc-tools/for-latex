\section{What does that mean in \tdocquote{English}?}

The macro \tdocmacro{tdocinEN} and its starred version are useless for English speakers because they have the following effects.


\begin{tdoclatex}
Cool and top stand for \tdocinEN*{cool} and \tdocinEN{top}.
\end{tdoclatex}


The macro \tdocmacro{tdocinEN} and its starred version are based on \tdocmacro{tdocquote} : for example, \tdocquote{semantic} is obtained via \tdocinlatex|tdocquote{semantic}| .


\begin{tdocnote}
    As the text \tdocquote{in English} is translated into the language detected by \thisproj, the macro \tdocmacro{tdocinEN} and its starred version become useful for non-English speakers.
\end{tdocnote}
