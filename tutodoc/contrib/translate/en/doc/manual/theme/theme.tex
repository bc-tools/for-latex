\section{Choose your theme}

    To modify the general layout, there is the \thisproj\ class option \tdocinlatex{theme = <choice>} where \tdocinlatex{<choice>} can take the following values.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \tdocinlatex|bw| :
    this is a black-and-white theme with some shades of gray.

    \item \tdocinlatex|color| :
    this theme is colored, \emph{it's the default value}.

    \item \tdocinlatex|dark| :
    this theme is dark, ideal for resting the eyes.

    \item \tdocinlatex|draft|:
    this theme is just right for a printout to look for content errors that aren't necessarily easy to spot in front of a screen.
\end{itemize}


\begin{tdocnote}
    At the end of this document, after the change history, you'll find a gallery of use cases for these different themes : go to appendix page \pageref{tutodoc-theme-gallery}.
