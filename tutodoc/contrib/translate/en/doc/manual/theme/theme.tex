\section{Choose your theme}

To modify the general layout, there is the \thisproj\ class option \tdoclatexin{theme = <choice>} where \tdoclatexin{<choice>} can take the following values.

\begin{tasks}[style=itemize]
    \task \tdoclatexin{bw}:
          a black-and-white theme with some shades of grey.

    \task \tdoclatexin{color}:
          a coloured theme : this is the default value.
w
    \task \tdoclatexin{dark}:
          a dark theme ideal for resting the eyes.

    \task \tdoclatexin{draft}:
          a theme for a printout such as to look for content errors that aren't necessarily easy to spot in front of a screen.
\end{tasks}


\begin{tdocnote}
