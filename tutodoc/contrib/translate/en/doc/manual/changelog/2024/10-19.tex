\begin{tdocbreak}
	\item The \thisproj\ class replaces the now-defunct \thisproj\ package (for the moment, the young class offers no specific options).

	\item The \tdocmacro{tdocruler} macro is now used via \tdocinlatex{\tdocruler[<color>]{<text>}} (remember that the old syntax was \tdocinlatex{\tdocruler{<text>}{<color>}}).
\end{tdocbreak}


\begin{tdocfix}
	\item Version 3 of \tdocpack{minted} is taken into account.

	\item The \tdocmacro{tdocdate} macro did not handle date format and formatting.

	\item Colored frames did not color text after a page break.
\end{tdocfix}


\begin{tdocnew}
	\item The class is usable in Spanish.

	\item The documentation contains a new section explaining how to contribute.
\end{tdocnew}
