\subsection{With framing lines}

To make the formatted \LaTeX\ code more visible, you can use the \tdoclatexin{rule} style, as in the following examples.


\begin{tdocexa}
	The option \tdoclatexin{style = rule} provides the following where the automatically added texts will adapt to the language found by \thisproj.

	\input{examples/showcase/rule.tex}
\end{tdocexa}


\begin{tdocexa}[Editable text and colours]
	You can easily obtain the following horror.

	\input{examples/showcase/rule-custom.tex}

	Here's the code that was used.%
	\footnote{
		The next section will justify the a priori strange choice of \tdoclatexin{col-stripe} instead of \tdoclatexin{col-rule}\,.
	}

	\tdoclatexinput<\tdoctcb{code}>{examples/showcase/rule-custom.tex}
\end{tdocexa}


\begin{tdocnote}
    In the previous example, the text uses the proposed darkened orange. However, the red is used as a base to obtain the colors used for the framing lines: the transformations used depend on the theme chosen.%
    \footnote{
        For example, the themes \tdoclatexin{bw} and \tdoclatexin{draft} ignore the key \tdoclatexin{col-stripe}!
    }
    You should also be aware that behind the scenes, the macro \tdocmacro{tdocruler} is used, it works as follows.

    \begin{tdoclatex}<\tdoctcb{std}>
\tdocruler[red]{A decorated pseudo-title}
    \end{tdoclatex}
\end{tdocnote}
