\section{What language is used by the \thisproj\ class?}

This documentation loads the \tdocpack{babel} package via \tdoclatexin|\usepackage[english]{babel}|\, a package that \thisproj\ does not load.
On the other hand, the \thisproj\ class identifies \tdoclatexin|en| as the main language used by \tdocpack{babel}.%.
\footnote{
    Technically, we use \tdoclatexin|\BCPdata{language}| which returns a language in short format.
}
As this language is included in the list of languages taken into account, see below, the \thisproj\ class will produce the expected effects.
% Do not touch the following placeholder.
<<API-LANGS>>


\begin{tdocnote}
    Packages \tdocpack{babel} and \tdocpack{polyglossia} are taken into account.
\end{tdocnote}


\begin{tdoccaut}
    If the choice of main language is not made in the preamble, the mechanism used will fail with unintended side effects (see warning that follows).
\end{tdoccaut}


\begin{tdocwarn}
    When a language is not supported by \thisproj, a warning message is issued, and English is selected as the language for \thisproj.
\end{tdocwarn}
