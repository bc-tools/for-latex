\section{What language is used by the \thisproj\ class?}

This documentation loads the \tdocpack{babel} package via \tdocinlatex|\usepackage[english]{babel}|\,.
As a result, the \thisproj\ class identifies \tdocinlatex|en| as the main language used by \tdocpack{babel}.%.
\footnote{
	Technically, we use \tdocinlatex|\BCPdata{language}| which returns a language in short format.
} 
As this language is included in the list of languages taken into account, see below, the \thisproj\ class will produce the expected effects.
% Do not touch the following placeholder. 
<<LANG-SUPPORTED>>


\begin{tdocimp}
	If the choice of main language is not made in the preamble, the mechanism used will fail with unintended side effects (see warning that follows).
\end{tdocimp}


\begin{tdoccaut}
	If the choice of main language is not made in the preamble, the mechanism used will fail with unintended side effects (see warning that follows).
\end{tdoccaut}


\begin{tdocwarn}
    When a language is not supported by \thisproj, a warning message is issued, and English is selected as the language for \thisproj.
\end{tdocwarn}


\begin{tdocnote}
    The mechanism used should be compatible with the \tdocpack{polyglossia} package.
\end{tdocnote}
