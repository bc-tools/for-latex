\begin{tdocimp}
	If you want to participate in \thisproj\, you'll need to use the \LaTeX3 programming paradigm.
\end{tdocimp}


Participation as a coder is made via the \thisrepo\ repository corresponding to the \verb#tutodoc# development branch.
Do not use the \verb#main# branch, which is used to freeze the latest stable versions of projects in the single \thismonorepo\ repository.
