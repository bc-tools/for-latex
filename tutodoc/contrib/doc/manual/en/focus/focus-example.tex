\section{Highlighting content}

\begin{tdocnote}
    The environments presented in this section
    \footnote{
        The formatting comes from the \tdocpack{keytheorems} package.
    }
    add a short title indicating the type of information provided.
    This short text will always be translated into the language indicated when the \thispack{} package is loaded.
\end{tdocnote}



\subsection{Examples}

Numbered or unnumbered examples can be indicated using the \tdocenv{tdocexa} environment, which offers two optional arguments.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \ordinalnum{1} argument between brackets \tdocinlatex#<...># can take the values \tdocinlatex#nb# to number, which is the default setting, and \tdocinlatex#nonb# to not number.

    \item The \ordinalnum{2} argument in square brackets \tdocinlatex#[...]# is used to add a mini-title..
\end{enumerate}


Here are some possible uses.

\tdoclatexinput[sbs]{examples/focus/exa.tex}


% ------------------ %


\begin{tdocimp}
    The numbering of the examples is reset to zero as soon as a section with a level at least equal to a \tdocinlatex|\subsubsection| is opened.
\end{tdocimp}


% ------------------ %


\begin{tdoctip}
    It can sometimes be useful to return to the line at the start of the content. The code below shows how to proceed (this trick also applies to the \verb#tdocrem# environment presented next). Note in passing that the numbering follows that of the previous example as desired.
