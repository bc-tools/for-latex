One major \chge and a minor one.

    1) The class doesn't have any \lang option. Instead, we look for the \latex "kernel" value of ''\BCPdata{language}'' that is managed by the \packs ''babel'' and ''polyglossia''.

    1) ``\tdocruler``: the \sign of this macro has been changed from ''{<text>}{<color>}'' to ''[<color>]{<text>}'' with the black as the default color.
