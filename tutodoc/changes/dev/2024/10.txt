[[:api:]]
One major \chge and a minor one.

    1) The incoming class doesn't have any \lang option. Instead, we look for the \latex "kernel" value of ''\BCPdata{language}'' that is managed by the \packs ''babel'' and ''polyglossia''.

    1) ''\tdocruler'': the \sign of this macro has been changed from ''{<text>}{<color>}'' to ''[<color>]{<text>}'' with the black as the default color.

[[:api:]]
Dates untranslated: the \args was not correctly sent to ''\tutodoc@new@change@margin'' from ''\tdocdate''.

[[:doc:]]
Manual: examples like ''\tdocinlatex{\mymacro[...]{...}}'' have been added to show the power of the macro ''\tdocinlatex''.
