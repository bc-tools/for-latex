[[:format:]]
The ‘’scrartcl‘’ class replaces the venerable ‘’article‘’. This means better placement of the margins with the options retained for loading ‘’scrartcl‘’.


[[:api:]]
Here are the breaking chges.

    1) \latex code: the macro ''\tdocinlatex'' has been renamed ''\tdoclatexin''.

    1) Color key names will be hyphenated where necessary: this implies the following changes.

        * \Envs for latest \chges: the ''colchges'' option of the \envs has been renamed ''col-chges''.

        * Showcases: the ''colstripe'' and  ''coltext'' options of the \env ''tdocshowcase'' and the macro ''\tdocshowcaseinput'' have been renamed ''col-stripe'' and  ''col-text''.

[[:api:]]
Admonitions: for the ''\newkeytheorem'' used with the ''draft'' theme, we have added ''postheadhook = \leavevmode'' (this is necessary because the content can naturally be of the list type).

[[:doc:]]
Addition of a section listing dependencies.


[[:api:]]
Here are the new fetaures.

    1) \Cls options.

        * Options not specific to \thisproj are passed on to the class in charge of general formatting.

        * The options ''fontsize'' and ''DIV'' can't be used because their values are fixed by \thisproj.


    1) ''\tdocinEN'' macro: the English linguistic rules are respected between the quotes.

    1) \Envs for latest \chges.

        * A new ''tdoctodo'' \env has been added.

        * Each \env has a new ''col'' option for color of the content indicating \chges.

[[:format:]]
Draft theme and \chges: the \envs for the kind of \chges stop to use icons.

[[:facto:]]
Simplified \orga of \cfg files in the final \proj.

    1) \Css-like: one file per theme with a name like path::''tutodoc-bw.css.cls''.

    1) Locale: use of names like path::''tutodoc-en.loc.cls''.
