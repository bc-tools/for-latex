[[:format:]]
The ‘’scrartcl‘’ class replaces the venerable ‘’article‘’. This means better placement of the margins with the options retained for loading ‘’scrartcl‘’.

[[:api:]]
Color key names will be hyphenated where necessary: this implies the following changes.

    1) Admonitions: the ''colchges'' option of the \envs has been renamed ''col-chges''.

    1) Showcases: the ''colstripe'' and  ''coltext'' options of the \env ''tdocshowcase'' and the macro ''\tdocshowcaseinput'' have been renamed ''col-stripe'' and  ''col-text''.

\Cls options.

    1) Options not specific to \thisproj are passed on to the class in charge of general formatting.

    1) The options ''fontsize'' and ''DIV'' can't be used because their values are fixed by \thisproj.


''\tdocinEN'' macro: the English linguistic rules are respected between the quotes.


Admonitions.

    1) A new ''tdoctodo'' \env has been added.

    1) Each \env has a new ''col'' option for color of the material indicating \chges.
