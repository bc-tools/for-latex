The `LaTeX` package `tutodoc`
=============================

About `tutodoc`

> `tutodoc` comes from *"tutorial-like documentation"*.


Where is the documentation?
---------------------------

At this time, there is only one French documentation writing with a tutorial-like flavor : look at the folder `rollout/doc`.
