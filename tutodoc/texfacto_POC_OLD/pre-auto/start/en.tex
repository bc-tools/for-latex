\begin{abstract}
The \tdocpack{tutodoc} package
\footnote{
    The name comes from \tdocquote{\tdocprewhy{tuto.rial-type} \tdocprewhy{doc.umentation}}.
}
is used by its author to semantically produce documentation of \LaTeX\ packages and classes in a tutorial style
\footnote{
    The idea is to produce an efficient \texttt{PDF} file that can be browsed for one-off needs. This is generally what is expected of coding documentation.
},
and with a sober rendering for reading on screen.


\begin{tdocnote}
    This package imposes a formatting style. In the not-too-distant future, \tdocpack{tutodoc} will probably be split into a class and a package.
