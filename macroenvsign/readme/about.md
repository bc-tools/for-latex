About `macroenvsign`
--------------------

This package proposes tools for writing pure technical user documentations of `LaTeX` packages.

  1. Several macros allow to explain easily the signature of macros, environments, and `xtemplates`.

  1. The signature of each macros and environments, and `xtemplates` documented is exported in a file such as to be used by external tools.
