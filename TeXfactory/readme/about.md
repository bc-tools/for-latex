About `TeXfactory`
------------------

This module proposes `Python` tools to automate the production of a `TeX` project from a `STY` source directory using a standardized workflow (the idea is to code using small parts of the project rather than big `STY` files).

> *For now, only packages are supported, the case of classes will be implemented later, as the author does not use this kind of stuff yet.*
