for-latex (monorepo) - ROADMAP
====================

This file is a roadmap, in the short term.


-----------
ALWAYS DONE
-----------

    1) Nothing at this time.


----------
NEXT STEPS
----------

    1) TeXfactory

        ---> tutodoc
                + moving from POC to code :
                  some issues to solve
                + real use case for testing
                + debug folder from test folder sucha as to easily test something : we simply copy tlv file by adding  .tex extension : it is the rsponsability of the dev to chnage the code of the original tlv if needed

    1) macroenvsign: new version to build and publish
