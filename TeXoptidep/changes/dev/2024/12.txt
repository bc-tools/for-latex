Here are the first features.

    1) Imports made: extracting imports of \clss and \packs of one given ext::''sty'' or ext::''cls'' file (the options selected are captured).

    1) \yaml file reports of the \cls and \pack used.

    1) \yaml file reports of the version of the \cls and \pack used (useful when unit tests are made).
