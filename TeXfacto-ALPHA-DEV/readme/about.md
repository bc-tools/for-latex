About `TeXfacto`
----------------

This module proposes `Python` tools to automate the production of a `TeX` project from a `STY` source directory using a standardized workflow (the idea is to code using small parts of the project rather than big `STY` files).

> *For the moment, `TeXfacto` is focused on `LaTeX` projects using `STY` files on the coding side with written documentation management via `TEX` files, resource files being possible.. The case of classes will be implemented later, as the author does not use this kind of stuff yet.*
